This directory contains replacement files that should enable experimental
ARMv7 instrumentation in place of the default x86 code. Several notes:

  - The code is confirmed to work only in the sense that it allows libpng 
    and jpeg9c to be compiled with ./configure --disable-shared and run
    without catching fire. A lot more testing is necessary to declare victory. 

  - In fact, something is known to go wrong when --disable-shared is *NOT*
    specified; possibly a stack corruption bug. I need to investigate.

  - To compile on ARM, you need to take several manual steps:

    1) Copy the *.c and *.h files in this directory to the root directory of 
       the project (../../), overwriting the original code,

    2) Edit the top-level Makefile to delete the first line that mentions
       '__asm__' (without quotes).

    3) Type in 'make clean all',

    4) Cross your fingers for good measure.
