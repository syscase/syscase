This directory contains replacement files that should enable experimental
ARMv7 instrumentation in place of the default x86 code. Several notes:

  - This code is UNFINISHED AND NO LONGER MAINTAINED and lags behind the
    rest of afl-fuzz. You are very much on your own.

  - The code was once confirmed to work only in the sense that it allowed
    libpng and jpeg9c to be compiled with ./configure --disable-shared and run
    without catching fire. 

  - Even at that point, something was known to be broken when you wouldn't
    specify --disable-shared is. The most likely explanation is that there was
    a jump table / literal pool that afl-as did not recognize and injected
    instrumentation into, breaking alignment.

To compile on ARM, you need to take several manual steps:

1) Copy the *.c and *.h files in this directory to the root directory of 
   the project (../../), overwriting the original code,

2) Edit the top-level Makefile to delete the first line that mentions
   '__asm__' (without quotes).

3) Type in 'make clean all',

4) Cross your fingers for good measure.
