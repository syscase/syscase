Here's a quick overview of the stuff you can find in this directory:

  - arm_support         - a very experimental and unstable support for ARMv7.

  - bash_harness        - a simple shell harness used to find a bunch of
                          post-Shellshock bugs.

  - canvas_harness      - a test harness used to find browser bugs with a 
                          corpus generated using simple image parsing 
                          binaries & afl-fuzz.

  - clang_asm_normalize - a script that makes it easy to instrument
                          hand-written assembly, provided that you have clang.

  - crash_triage        - a very rudimentary example of how to annotate crashes
                          with additional gdb metadata.

  - distributed_fuzzing - a sample script for synchronizing fuzzer instances
                          across multiple machinnes (see parallel_fuzzing.txt).

  - instrumented_cmp    - an experiment showing how a custom memcmp() or
                          strcmp() can be used to work around one of the
                          limitations of afl-fuzz.

  - libpng_no_checksum  - a sample patch for removing CRC checks in libpng.

Note that the minimize_corpus.sh tool has graduated from the experimental/
directory and is now available as ../afl-cmin.

Most of these are meant chiefly as examples that need to be tweaked for your
specific needs. They come with some basic documentation, but are not really
production-grade.
