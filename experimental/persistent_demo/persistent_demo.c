   This file demonstrates the high-performance "persistent mode" that may be
   suitable for fuzzing certain fast and well-behaved libraries, provided that
   they are stateless or that their internal state can be easily reset
   across runs.

   To make this work, the library and this shim need to be compiled in LLVM
   mode using afl-clang-fast (other compiler wrappers will *not* work); and
   afl-fuzz must be called with AFL_PERSISTENT set.
