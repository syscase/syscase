Environmental variables
=======================

  (See README for the general instruction manual)

Several components of American Fuzzy Lop make use of environmental variables
to implement features that may be useful for power users or may come handy
in scripting environments.

1) Settings for afl-gcc, afl-clang, and afl-as
----------------------------------------------

  - Setting AFL_QUIET will prevent afl-cc and afl-as banners from being
    displayed during compilation, in case you find them distracting.

  - AFL_PATH can be used to point to the location of afl-as, which is
    especially useful if you have an older version installed system-wide, and
    don't want to use that.

  - Setting AFL_HARDEN automatically adds code hardening options when invoking
    the downstream compiler. This currently includes -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 and
    -fstack-protector-all. The option is useful for catching non-crashing
    memory bugs at the expense of a very slight (sub-5%) performance loss.

  - By default, the wrapper appends -O3 to optimize builds. In the exceedingly
    unlikely case this causes problems, set AFL_DONT_OPTIMIZE.

  - Setting AFL_USE_ASAN automatically enables ASAN, provided that your
    compiler supports that. Note that fuzzing with ASAN is problematic - see
    notes_for_asan.txt.

  - Setting AFL_CC and AFL_CXX lets you use alternate downstream compilers,
    rather than the default 'clang' or 'gcc' binary in your $PATH.

  - Setting AFL_INST_RATIO to a percentage between 0 and 100% controls the
    probability of instrumenting every branch. This is (very rarely) useful
    when dealing with exceptionally complex programs that saturate the output
    bitmap. 

    (If this ever happens, afl-fuzz will warn you ahead of the time by
    displaying the "bitmap density" field in fiery red.)

  - TMPDIR is used by afl-as for temporary files; if this variable is not set,
    the tool defaults to /tmp.

2) Settings for afl-showap
--------------------------

  - Setting AFL_QUIET inhibits the banner and other non-essential messages
    from the tool.

  - Setting AFL_SINK_OUTPUT redirects all output from the tested program to
    /dev/null, so that all you see is a list of tuples recorded by the
    instrumentation. Very useful for test case de-duplication scripts.

3) Settings for afl-fuzz
------------------------

None at this point. Several user-serviceable settings (e.g., the use of
terminal colors) can be adjusted via config.h.

If these variables are not already present in the environment, the tool
automatically sets LD_BIND_NOW to 1 and ASAN_OPTIONS to:

  abort_on_error=1
  detect_leaks=0
  allocator_may_return_null=1

Do not overrie abort_on_error=1 when using ASAN, since doing so would prevent
out-of-bounds access bugs from being detected as such.
