--------------
Version 0.74b:
--------------

  - More responsive exec speed averages an UI speed scaling.

  - Fix for interrupted reads on Solaris. Submitted by Martin Carpenter.

--------------
Version 0.73b:
--------------

  - Fix a stray memcpy() instead of memmove() on overlapping buffers.
    Mostly harmless but still dumb. Spotted thanks to David Higgs.

--------------
Version 0.72b:
--------------

  - Map size bumped up to 32k. You may want to recompile instrumented
    binaries (but nothing horrible will happen if you don't).

  - Huge performance improvements for bit-counting functions.

  - Default optimizations now include -funroll-loops. This should have
    interesting effects on the instrumentation. Frankly, I'm just going to
    ship it and see what happens next. I have a good feeling about this.

  - Fix for stack alignment crash on MacOS X 10.10; looks like the 
    rhetorical question in the comments in afl-as.h has been answered.
    Spotted by Mudge Zatko.

--------------
Version 0.71b:
--------------

  - A fix for the nonsensical MacOS ELF check. Spotted by Mudge Zatko.

  - Improvements to ASAN checks.

--------------
Version 0.70b:
--------------

  - Explicit detection of ASAN.

  - Patches to compile on Solaris. Contributed by Martin Carpenter.

--------------
Version 0.69b:
--------------

  - Improved detection of non-instrumented binaries.

  - Crash counter in -C mode is now accurate.

  - Fix for an obscure install bug that made afl-as non-functional with the tool
    installed to /usr/bin instead of /usr/local/bin. Found by Florian Kiersch.

  - Fix for a cosmetic SIGFPE when Ctrl-C is pressed while the fork server
    is spinning up.

--------------
Version 0.68b:
--------------

  - Crash exploration mode! Woot!

--------------
Version 0.67b:
--------------

  - Several more typos fixed, the project is now cartified 100% typo-free.
    Thanks to Thomas Jarosch and Jakub Wilk.

  - Write fuzzer_stats early on.

  - Minor fix for MacOS X operation as root. Spotted by Tobias Ospelt.

  - Make it possible to override -O3. Patch by Jakub Wilk.

--------------
Version 0.66b:
--------------

  - Fix for a very obscure issue with build systems that use gcc as an assembler
    for hand-written .s files, confusing afl-as. Affected nss. Reported by
    Hanno Boeck.

  - Fix for a bug when cleaning up synchronized fuzzer output dirs. Reported by
    Thomas Jarosch.

--------------
Version 0.65b:
--------------

  - Fix for shell printf escape codes in Makefile. Reported by Jakub Wilk.

  - A bit more color to fuzzer_stats, short documentation of the file format,
    and several other stats-related improvements.

--------------
Version 0.64b:
--------------

  - Enable GCC support on MacOS X.

--------------
Version 0.63b:
--------------

  - New, simplified way to pass data in files (@@). See README.

  - Final fixes for 64-bit MacOS X, working around a crashing bug in their
    linker (umpf) and several other things. It's alive!

  - A minor workaround for a bug in 64-bit FreeBSD (clang -m32 -g doesn't work
    on that platform, but clang -m32 does, so we no longer insert -g).

  - Build-time warning for inverse video terminals and better instructions in
    status_screen.txt.

--------------
Version 0.62b:
--------------

  - Minor improvements to the allocator, as suggested by Tobias Ospelt.

  - Example instrumented memcmp() in experimental/instrumented_cmp.

  - Speculative fix for MacOS X (clang detection, again).

  - Typo fix for parallel_fuzzing.txt, as reported by Thomas Jarosch.

--------------
Version 0.61b:
--------------

  - A trivial fix for clang detection on systems with a clang cc wrapper,
    so that it doesn't get confused with GCC and receives the necessary
    -no-integrated-as flag.

  - Cosmetic doc and CPU load indicator improvements.

  - Improvements for crash removal (README.txt left behind, d'oh).

--------------
Version 0.60b:
--------------

  - Fix for jump tables generated by exotic versions of GCC. This solves
    an outstanding problem on OpenBSD when using afl-gcc + PIE (not present
    with afl-clang).

  - Fixed permissions on one of the sample archives.

  - Added a lahf / sahf workaround for OpenBSD (their assembler doesn't know
    about these opcodes).

  - Added docs/INSTALL.

--------------
Version 0.59b:
--------------

  - make install now installs test cases, too.

  - Better pointers to installed README in afl-fuzz.

  - More work on RLIMIT_AS for OpenBSD.

--------------
Version 0.58b:
--------------

  - Core count check on Linux.

  - Additional refinements for the lack-of-RLIMIT_AS case on OpenBSD.

  - The tool now shows CPU utilization to help with optimal CPU loading.

--------------
Version 0.57b:
--------------

  - Fixes to make things work on FreeBSD and OpenBSD: use_64bit is
    inferred if not explicitly specified when calling afl-as, and
    RLIMIT_AS is behind an #ifdef. Thanks to Fabian Keil and Jonathan Gray.

  - Documentation is now installed, too (in /usr/local/share/doc/afl).

  - Typo fix in status_screen.txt.

  - Minor Makefile improvement suggested by Jakub Wilk.

--------------
Version 0.56b:
--------------

  - Probabilistic instrumentation density reduction in ASAN mode. This
    compensates for ASAN-specific branches in a crude but probably viable
    way.

  - Updated notes_for_asan.txt.

--------------
Version 0.55b:
--------------

  - Smarter out_dir behavior, automatically deleting directories that
    don't contain anything of special value. Requested by several folks,
    including Hanno Boeck.

  - Additional detail in fuzzer_stats (start time, run time, fuzzer PID).

  - Configurable install prefixes in Makefile ($PREFIX), as requested by
    Luca Barbato.

  - You can now resume by doing -i <out_dir>, without having to specify
    -i <out_dir>/queue/.

--------------
Version 0.54b:
--------------

  - A fix for -Wformat warning messages (oops, I thought this had been in
    place for a while). It's an unfortunate corner case where the compiler
    seems to be wrong. We use uint64_t (aliased to u64) for self-documenting,
    definite-size integers. This is coupled with %llu as a format for printf().

    The compiler always expects 'unsigned long long' for %llu. On 32-bit boxes,
    uint64_t is defined in <bits/types.h> as 'unsigned long long', so everything
    is peachy: the types match precisely.

    On 64-bit systems, uint64_t is defined as 'unsigned long' via an #ifdef. Of
    course, that happens to have the same size as 'unsigned long long' under
    the circumstances, *but* the compiler still freaks out about format type
    mismatch - presumably because that assertion would be not true on 32-bit
    systems, so it's typically indicative of a bug.

--------------
Version 0.53b:
--------------

  - Major revision of the crash & hang duplicate detection code to better
    deal with fault conditions that can be reached in a multitude of ways.

    The old approach could be compared to hashing stack traces to de-dupe
    crashes, a method prone to crash count inflation. The alternative I
    wanted to avoid would be equivalent to just looking at crash %eip,
    which can have false negatives in common functions such as memcpy().

    The middle ground currently used in afl-fuzz can be compared to looking
    at every line item in the stack trace and tagging crashes as unique if
    we see any function name that we haven't seen before (or if something that
    we have *always* seen there suddenly disappears). We do the comparison
    without paying any attention to ordering or hit counts. This can still
    cause some crash inflation early on, but the problem will quickly taper
    off. So, you may get 20 dupes instead of 5,000.
    
  - Bugfix for harmless but absurd trim ratios shown if the first exec in
    the trimmer timed out. Spotted by @EspenGx.

--------------
Version 0.52b:
--------------

  - Added a quick summary of the contents in experimental/.

  - Fix to the process of writing fuzzer_stats.

  - Slight reorganization of the .state/ directory, now recording
    redundant paths, too. Note that this breaks the ability to 
    properly resume older sessions - sorry about that.

    (To fix this, simply move <out_dir>/.state/* from an older run
    to <out_dir>/.state/deterministic_done/*.)

--------------
Version 0.51b:
--------------

  - afl-as search order changed to avoid the problem with older copies;
    this also means that I can remove the Makefile check for that.

  - Slight refactoring to allow instrumentation ratio of 0%, mostly as
    a novelty.

  - Moar typos!

  - test_prev target fix, as reported by Ozzy Johnson.

--------------
Version 0.50b:
--------------

  - Additional improvements to the installation script. Patch by Padraig Brady.

  - Various documentation improvements, especially around perf_tips.txt;
    based on the feedback from Alexander Cherepanov.

  - Added AFL_INST_RATIO to afl-as. The only case where this comes handy is
    ffmpeg, at least as far as I can tell. (Trivia: the current version of 
    ffmpeg ./configure also ignores CC and --cc, probably unintentionally).

  - Added documentation for all environmental variables (env_variables.txt).

  - Visual warning for excessive or insufficient bitmap density.

  - -O3 is now added by default; use AFL_DONT_OPTIMIZE if you don't like that.
    Big speed gain for ffmpeg, so seems like a good idea.

  - Minor fix to afl-as to ignore .LBB labels in gcc mode.

--------------
Version 0.49b:
--------------

  - More typo fixes (thanks to Jakub Wilk).

  - Support for clang!

  - AFL_HARDEN doesn't include ASAN by default anymore. Use AFL_USE_ASAN if
    needed. The reasons for this are in notes_for_asan.txt.

  - Switched from configure auto-detection to isatty() to keep afl-as and
    afl-gcc quiet.

  - Improved installation process to properly create symlinks, rather than
    copies of binaries (grr, /usr/bin/install).

--------------
Version 0.48b:
--------------

  - ASAN_OPTIONS=abort_on_error=1 is now force-set. Reported by Hanno Boeck.

  - Makefile mkdir improvements, as suggested by Hanno Boeck.

  - Properly save r8-r11 registers in the x86 setup code (this could cause rare
    problems running *without* instrumentation when the first function called
    in a particular .o file has 5+ parameters). No impact on code running under
    afl-fuzz or afl-showmap. Reported by Padraig Brady.

--------------
Version 0.47b:
--------------

  - Another minor fix for parallel builds of afl, suggested by
    Richard W. M. Jones.

  - Support for suffixes for -m.

  - Documentation updates, notes_for_asan.txt. Based on feedback from
    Hanno Boeck, Ben Laurie, and others.

  - Move to http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/.

--------------
Version 0.46b:
--------------

  - Makefile dependencies cleaned up for parallel builds. Requested by 
    Richard W. M. Jones.

  - Support for DESTDIR in Makefile. Suggested by Richard W. M. Jones.

  - Removed all the USE_64BIT stuff; we now just auto-detect compilation mode.
    As requested by many callers to the show.

  - Fix for rare problems with programs that use snippets of assembly and
    switch between .code32 and .code64. Fixes a problem reported by
    Hanno Boeck with compiling ToT gdb.

--------------
Version 0.45b:
--------------

  - Test case trimmer. Results in 20-30% size reduction for many types of work
    loads, with very pronounced improvements in path discovery speeds.

  - Better warning for input directories.

  - Test and warning for older copies, based on counterintuitive behavior
    noticed by Hovik Manucharyan.

  - Added fuzzer_stats file for status monitoring. Suggested by @dronesec.

  - Typo fixes, thanks to Alexander Cherepanov.

  - Better warnings about ASAN memory requirements, based on feedback from
    several users.

  - Saner support for non-tty stdout (less output generated, no ANSI art).

--------------
Version 0.44b:
--------------

  - Support for AFL_CC and AFL_CXX (thanks to Ben Laurie).

  - Option combination -S -D replaced with -M for simplicity.

  - Extra check for .section .text; lack of this prevented main() from
    getting instrumented for some users. Reported by Tom Ritter.

  - Reorganization of the testcases/ directory.

  - An extra check to confirm that the build is operational.

  - Consistent use of color reset codes, as suggested by Oliver Kunz.

--------------
Version 0.43b:
--------------

  - Fix for 64-bit gcc -shared reloc bug.

  - echo -e removed from Makefile for compatibility with dash. Suggested
    by Jakub Wilk.

  - Added status_screen.txt.

  - Added canvas_harness.

  - Minor change to the GCC check. Suggested by Hanno Boeck.

--------------

--------------

  - Red zone fix for 64-bit (oops!). Problem reported by Felix Groebert.

  - Horribly experimental ARM support in experimental/arm_support.

  - Several improvements to error messages.

  - Added AFL_QUIET to silence afl-gcc and afl-as when using wonky build
    systems. Reported by Hanno Boeck.

  - Improved check for 64-bit compilation, plus several sanity checks
    in Makefile.

--------------
Version 0.41b:
--------------

  - Fork server fix for processes that call execve().

  - Minor compatibility fixes to Makefile, afl-gcc; suggested by Jakub
    Wilk.

  - Fixes to triage_crashes.sh. Suggested by Jakub Wilk.

  - Multiple instrumentation performance improvements.

  - Visual indication of the number of imported paths.

  - Fix to afl-showmap to make it work well with new instrumentation.

  - Much better messages for crashes early on.

--------------
Version 0.40b:
--------------

  - Proper support for parallelized fuzzing. Inspired by earlier patch
    from Sebastian Roschke.

  - Added an example in experimental/distributed_fuzzing/

--------------
Version 0.39b:
--------------

  - Redesigned status screen, now 90% more spiffy.

  - More verbose and user-friendly messages for some common problems.

    fuzzing sessions.

  - Removed the -D option, as it's no longer necessary.

  - Refactored calibration code and improved startup reporting.

  - Dynamically scaled timeouts.

  - Visual notification for slow binaries.

  - Improved instrumentation to explicitly cover the other leg of every
    branch.

--------------
Version 0.36b:
--------------

  - Fork server support to avoid the overhead of execve(). A nearly-verbatim
    design from Jann Horn; still pending part 2 that would also skip initial
    setup steps (thinking about reliable heuristics now).

  - Added a check for shell scripts used as fuzz targets.

  - Added a check for fuzz jobs that don't seem to be finding anything.

  - Fixes to how IGNORE_FINDS works (was a bit broken after adding splicing
    and path skip heuristics).

--------------
Version 0.35b:
--------------

  - 64-bit instrumentation properly integrated into afl-as.

--------------
Version 0.34b:
--------------

  - New exec count classifier (the working theory is that it gets meaningful
    coverage with fewer test cases spewed out).

--------------
Version 0.33b:
--------------

  - New, somewhat experimental instrumentation that tries to target only
    arcs, rather than every line. May be fragile, but is a lot faster (2x+).
    Old version included in experimental/old_as/ for time being.

  - Several cosmetic fixes and typo corrections, thanks to Jakub Wilk.

--------------
