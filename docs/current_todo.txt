  (See README for the general instruction manual)

Here's the list of stuff I want to implement in afl:

  - More test cases (see testcases/wishlist.txt).

  - Perhaps a rewrite of the fork server code in C that gets precompiled
    with -S and then appended alongside with the instrumentation.

  - A second part of Jann's fork server patch, which allows us to skip setup
    steps for certain slow programs.

  - A pluggable version of fuzz_one(), so that people can write syntax-aware
    mutators or filters more easily.

  - Perhaps afl-fuzz.c broken into several smaller files for aesthetic
    purposes.

  - Proper support for threads, with prev_loc traced on a per-tid basis?
    (This may be slow.)

  - Support for DynamoRIO (or pin) for closed-source instrumentation in
    non-obfuscated binaries.

I'm not particularly convinced about adding more exotic output modes, for
example to send data to a TCP or UDP socket, or serve it off one. Ditto for
supporting "remote" execution with execution code phoned back in by a
harness. It's probably more effort than it's worth.
