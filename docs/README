1) Challenges of guided fuzzing
-------------------------------

Fuzzing is one of the most powerful strategies for identifying security issues
in real-world software. Unfortunately, it also offers fairly shallow coverage,
because many of the mutations needed to reach new code paths are exceedingly
unlikely to be hit purely by chance.

There have been numerous attempts to solve this problem by augmenting the
process with additional information about the behavior of the tested code.
These techniques can be divided into three broad groups:

  - Simple coverage maximization. This approach boils down to trying to find
    initial test cases that offer diverse code coverage in the targeted
    application - and then fuzzing that corpus using conventional strategies.

  - Dynamic control flow analysis. A more sophisticated technique that leverages
    instrumented binaries and taint tracking to identify mutations that will
    hopefully trigger new internal states within the tested program.

  - Static analysis / symbolic execution. Uses mathematical models to reason
    about the relationship between inputs and program states before actually
    running the code.

The first technique is surprisingly powerful when used to pre-select initial test
cases from a massive corpus of valid data. Unfortunately, such corpora are not
always available. On top of this, coverage measurements provide only a very
simplistic view of the internal state of the program, making them less suited
for guiding the fuzzing process later on.

The latter two techniques are extremely promising in experimental settings, but
in real-world applications, they frequently suffer from reliability problems or
irreducible complexity. Most of the high-value targets have enough internal
states and possible execution paths to make such tools fall apart and perform
strictly worse than their traditional counterparts.

2) The afl-fuzz approach
------------------------

American Fuzzy Lop is a brute-force fuzzer coupled with an exceedingly simple
but rock-solid instrumentation-guided genetic algorithm. It uses an enhanced
form of edge coverage to easily detect subtle, local-scale changes to program
control flow, without being bogged down by complex comparisons between multiple
long-winded execution paths.

The overall algorithm can be summed up as:

  1) Load user-supplied initial test cases into the queue,

  2) Take next input file from the queue,

  3) Attempt to trim the test case to the smallest size that doesn't alter
     the measured behavior of the program,

  4) Repeatedly mutate the file using a balanced and well-researched variety
     of traditional fuzzing strategies,

  5) If any of the generated mutations resulted in a new state transition
     recorded by the instrumentation, add mutated output as a new entry in the
     queue.

  6) Go to 2.

The discovered test cases are also periodically culled to eliminate ones that
have been obsoleted by newer, higher-coverage finds.

The strategies mentioned in step 4 are fairly straightforward, but go well
beyond the functionality of  tools such as zzuf and honggfuzz and lead to
additional finds; this is discussed in more detail at http://goo.gl/SoZJ47.

As a side result of the fuzzing process, the tool creates a small,
self-contained corpus of interesting test cases. These are extremely useful
for seeding other, labor- or resource-intensive testing regimes - for example,
for stress-testing browsers, office applications, or graphics suites.

The fuzzer is thoroughly tested to deliver coverage far superior to blind
fuzzing or coverage-only tools without the need to dial in any settings or
adjust any knobs.

3) Instrumenting programs for use with AFL
------------------------------------------

Instrumentation is injected by a companion tool that works as a drop-in
replacement for gcc or clang in any standard build process for third-party code.

The instrumentation has a fairly modest performance impact; in conjunction with
other optimizations implemented by afl-fuzz, most programs can be fuzzed as fast
or even faster than possible with traditional tools.

The correct way to recompile the target program may vary depending on the
specifics of the build process, but a nearly-universal approach would be:

$ CC=/path/to/afl/afl-gcc ./configure
$ make clean all

For C++ programs, you will want:

$ CXX=/path/to/afl/afl-g++ ./configure

The clang wrappers (afl-clang and afl-clang++) are used in the same way.

When testing libraries, it is essential to either link the tested executable
against a static version of the instrumented library, or to set the right
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Usually, the simplest option is just:

$ CC=/path/to/afl/afl-gcc ./configure --disable-shared

Setting AFL_HARDEN=1 when calling 'make' will cause the CC wrapper to
automatically enable code hardening options that make it easier to detect
simple memory bugs. The cost of this is a <5% performance drop.

Oh: when using ASAN, see the notes_for_asan.txt file for important caveats.

4) Choosing initial test cases
------------------------------

To operate correctly, the fuzzer requires one or more starting file containing
typical input normally expected by the targeted application. There are
two basic rules:

  - Keep the files small. Under 1 kB is ideal, although not strictly necessary.
    For a discussion of why size *really* matters, see perf_tips.txt.

  - Use multiple test cases only if they are fundamentally different from
    each other. There is no point in using fifty different vacation photos to
    fuzz an image library.

You can find quite a few good examples of starting files in the testcases/
subdirectory that comes with this tool.

If a large corpus of data is available for screening, you may want to use the
afl-showmap utility to compare instrumentation output and reject redundant
files. See experimental/minimization_script/ for an example of how to implement
this.

5) Fuzzing instrumented binaries
--------------------------------

The fuzzing process itself is carried out by the afl-fuzz utility. The program
requires a read-only directory with initial test cases, a separate place to
store its findings, plus a path to the binary to test.

For programs that accept input directly from stdin, the usual syntax may be:

$ ./afl-fuzz -i testcase_dir -o findings_dir /path/to/program [...params...]

For programs that take input from a file, use '@@' to mark the location where
the input file name should go. The fuzzer will substitute this for you:

$ ./afl-fuzz -i testcase_dir -o findings_dir /path/to/program -r @@

You can also use the -f option to have the mutated data written to a specific
file. This is useful if the program expects a particular file extension or so.

It is possible to fuzz non-instrumented code using the -n flag. This gives you
a fairly traditional fuzzer with a couple of nice testing strategies.

You can use -t and -m to override the default timeout and memory limit for the
executed process; this is seldom necessary, perhaps except for video decoders.

Tips for optimizing the performance of the process are discussed in
perf_tips.txt. Note that the fuzzer starts by meticulously performing an array
of deterministic fuzzing steps, which can take many hours or days. If you want
more traditional behavior akin to zzuf or honggfuzz, use the -d option to get
quick but less systematic and less in-depth results right away.

6) Interpreting output
----------------------

The fuzzing process will continue until you press Ctrl-C. See the
status_screen.txt file for information on how to interpret the displayed stats
and monitor the health of the process.

There are three subdirectories created within the output directory and updated
in real time:

  - queue/   - test cases for every distinctive execution path, plus all the
               starting files given by the user. This is, in effect, the
               synthesized corpus mentioned in section 2.

  - hangs/   - unique test cases that cause the tested program to time out. Note
               that the default timeouts are fairly aggressive (set at 5x the
               average execution time) to keep things moving fast.

  - crashes/ - unique test cases that cause the tested program to receive a
               fatal signal (e.g., SIGSEGV, SIGILL, SIGABRT). The entries are 
               grouped by the received signal.

Crashes and hangs are considered "unique" if the associated execution paths
involve any state transitions not seen in previously-recorded faults. If a
single bug can be reached in multiple ways, there will be some count inflation
early in the process, but this should quickly taper off.

The file names for crashes and hangs should let you correlate them with the
parent, non-faulting queue entries. This should help with debugging.

Any existing output directory can be also used to resume aborted jobs; simply do:

$ ./afl-fuzz -i old_output_dir -o new_output_dir [...etc...]

7) Parallelized fuzzing
-----------------------

For tips on how to fuzz a common target on multiple cores or multiple networked
machines, please refer to parallel_fuzzing.txt.

8) Crash exploration
--------------------

The coverage-based grouping of crashes usually produces a small data set that
can be quickly triaged manually or with a very simple GDB or Valgrind script.

Of course, it's important to acknowledge that some fuzzing crashes can be
difficult quickly evaluate for exploitability without a lot of debugging and
code analysis work. To assist with this task, afl-fuzz supports a very unique
"crash exploration" mode enabled with the -C flag.

In this mode, the fuzzer takes one or more crashing test cases as the input,
and uses its feedback-driven fuzzing strategies to very quickly enumerate all
code paths that can be reached in the program while keeping it in the
crashing state.

Mutations that do not result in a crash are rejected; so are any changes that
do not affect the execution path.

The output is a small corpus of files that can be very rapidly examined to see
what degree of control the attacker has over the faulting address, or whether
it is possible to get past an initial out-of-bounds read - and see what lies
beneath.

Oh - for test case minimization, consider https://code.google.com/p/tmin/.

9) Known limitations & areas for improvement
--------------------------------------------

Here are some of the most important caveats for AFL:

  - The fuzzer is optimized for compact data formats, such as images
    and other multimedia. It is less suited for human-readable formats with
    particularly verbose, redundant verbiage - say, XHTML or JavaScript. In
    such cases, template- or ABNF-based generators tend to fare better.

    Of course, if you want to modify the code to generate syntax-aware
    mutations, go ahead! You'd want to start with fuzz_one() in afl-fuzz.c.

  - As with any other brute-force tool, the fuzzer offers limited coverage if
    encryption, checksums, cryptographic signatures, or compression are used to
    wholly wrap the actual data format to be tested.

    To work around this, you may need to comment out the relevant checks in the
    tested programs, or use a wrapper that postprocesses the data generated by
    afl-fuzz.

    As a simple example, a patch for libpng to bypass CRC checksums is provided 
    in experimental/libpng_no_checksum/libpng-nocrc.patch. A more complex
    real-world harness for fwknop can be found at:

      https://github.com/mrash/fwknop/tree/master/test/afl

  - The included instrumentation (afl-as.h) currently supports x86. If you are
    feeling adventurous, an experimental ARM port can be found in
    experimental/arm_support/, too - but it's pretty brittle at this point.

  - Instrumentation of binary-only code is theoretically possible, but not
    supported today. Leveraging pin or DynamoRIO seems like a pretty simple
    project.

  - There are some unfortunate trade-offs with ASAN and 64-bit binaries. This
    isn't due to any specific fault of afl-fuzz; see notes_for_asan.txt for
    more.
