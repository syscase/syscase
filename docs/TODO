Here's my current wishlist for afl:

  - Part #2 of Jann's fork server patch.

  - Experimental support for ASAN edge coverage (to support clang).

  - Refactored fuzz_one to make it easier to plug custom mutators as
    standalone mods.

  - afl-fuzz.c broken into several files? It has gotten a bit too big.

  - Real support for threads (one prev_loc per tid?).

  - Maybe support for DynamoRIO or pin for binary-only instrumentation.
