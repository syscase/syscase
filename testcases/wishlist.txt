My secret wish list for minimal test cases:

  - JBIG,
  - Ogg Vorbis,
  - Ogg Theora,
  - MP3,
  - AAC,
  - WebM,
  - JPEG with ICC (LCMS),
  - Small font (Freetype),
  - Small PDF (Poppler),
  - Perhaps a couple more exotic compression formats.

If you end up creating minimalistic files for any of the above, or have
any other inputs worth sharing with the world, please let me know!
