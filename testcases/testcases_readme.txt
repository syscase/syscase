This directory contains small test cases for a variety of common data
formats, including images, archives, and so on.

In addition to this, there are several fuzzing dictionaries (-x) in
_extras/ - see ../docs/README for more.

If you wish to contribute other minimal test cases, my wishlist includes:

  - JBIG,
  - Ogg Vorbis,
  - Ogg Theora,
  - MP3,
  - AAC,
  - WebM,
  - Small JPEG with ICC (LCMS),
  - Small font (Freetype),
  - Perhaps a couple more exotic compression formats.

Of course, other contributions are also welcome!
